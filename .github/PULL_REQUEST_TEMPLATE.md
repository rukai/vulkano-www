The `master` branch is for the latest release on crates.io and is automatically deployed to production.
The `dev` branch is for the latest git master and is not deployed anywhere.

If you have changes that apply to both, make PRs against both branches.
If your change is only for unreleased changes, then make the PR against the `dev` branch.
